Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is an automated local version control where you can produce code, while GitHub is a collective remote resource where you can share and amend it without clashing.

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
A good analogy would be that Git is a notepad, while GitHub is a noticeboard where others can pin their feedback and add notes to others'.

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes, so long as one can remind oneself of how it works.

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
Yes.
