Core #2: Thinking like a Programmer

Describe the process for solving problems.
    Plan ahead. "Divide and rule". Think logically. Practice makes perfect.

Will you follow that process? How?
    If a problem seems too big to manage, break it up into more mangageable segments. Take regular breaks to lessen any sense of exhaustion. Get in touch with others or look up Google. Keep things simple.

What did you learn about flipped classroom?
    "Flipped learning" basically inverts the traditional classroom model and is more collaborative.

Core #3: Identity, Values and Strengths Activity


Core #4: Introduce yourself and get to know your cohort
What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? Could you feel your ego? Were you self coinsious?
    It's basically a group effort, so egoism wasn't an issue. We're all here to assist one another.

Tech #3: Install and Explore Git and GitHub - Course

What is a GitHub work flow?
    It allows multiple developers to collaborate more effectively on frequently updated projects, by way of version control and branching.

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
    When I encounter complex issues, or when tasks don't work out as planned, I seek external advice. I also re-read any primer info where necessary. 

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
