Core #2: Thinking like a Programmer
-----------------------------------

Describe the process for solving problems.

    Plan ahead. "Divide and rule". Think logically. Practice makes perfect.

Will you follow that process? How?

    If a problem seems too big to manage, break it up into more mangageable segments. Take regular breaks to lessen any sense of exhaustion. Get in touch with others or look up Google. Keep things simple.

What did you learn about flipped classroom?

    "Flipped learning" basically inverts the traditional classroom model and is more collaborative.

Core #3: Identity, Values and Strengths Activity
------------------------------------------------


Core #4: Introduce yourself and get to know your cohort
-------------------------------------------------------
What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? Could you feel your ego? Were you self coinsious?

    It's basically a group effort, so egoism wasn't an issue. We're all here to assist one another.

Tech #2: Version Control with Git - Primer
------------------------------------------

Whats the difference between git and GitHub?

    Git is an automated local version control where you can produce code, while GitHub is a collective remote resource where you can share and amend it without clashing.

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
    
    A good analogy would be that Git is a notepad, while GitHub is a noticeboard where others can pin their feedback and add notes to others'.

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

    Yes, so long as one can remind oneself of how it works.

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
    
    Yes.

Tech #3: Install and Explore Git and GitHub - Course
----------------------------------------------------

What is a GitHub work flow?

    It allows multiple developers to collaborate more effectively on frequently updated projects, by way of version control and branching.

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

    When I encounter complex issues, or when tasks don't work out as planned, I seek external advice. I also re-read any primers where necessary. 

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
    Not much, but I would probably seek second opinions about it. Namely how others handled it, and how the process could be made smoother.

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

    Taking breaks and not doing it all in one sitting usually works. The Udacity course on Github filled some vital gaps, by providing some handy tips on minor technical issues with Github.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

    It's variable so far, trying not to let the hard ones get in the way of the easy ones.

Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

    The practical components.

Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

    Material that's already been covered, or comes across as overly complex.

Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

    That Rome wasn't built in a day.
