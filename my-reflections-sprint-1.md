Core #2: Thinking like a Programmer
-----------------------------------

Describe the process for solving problems.

    Plan ahead. "Divide and rule". Think logically. Practice makes perfect.

Will you follow that process? How?

    If a problem seems too big to manage, break it up into more mangageable segments. Take regular breaks to lessen any sense of exhaustion. Get in touch with others or look up Google. Keep things simple.

What did you learn about flipped classroom?

    "Flipped learning" basically inverts the traditional classroom model and is more collaborative.

Core #3: Identity, Values and Strengths Activity
------------------------------------------------


Core #4: Introduce yourself and get to know your cohort
-------------------------------------------------------
What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? Could you feel your ego? Were you self coinsious?

    It's basically a group effort, so egoism wasn't an issue. We're all here to assist one another.

Tech #1: Command Line - Primer
------------------------------

In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain english? Can you think of an analogy for it?

    The command line uses direct text commands to access and modify files. A good analogy is examining and fixing the underlying mechanicals of a car.

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

    Yes, for the most part.

Name 5 commands you used, and what they do

    ls: Lists the files in the active directory.
    stage: Prepares file(s) for committing.
    commit: 'Solidifies' or 'welds' the file(s) for upload.
    push: Uploads file(s).
    status: Shows the current status of any changed files.

Did you learn anything unexpected?
    I learned how flexible the command line can be.

Tech #2: Version Control with Git - Primer
------------------------------------------

Whats the difference between git and GitHub?

    Git is an automated local version control where you can produce code, while GitHub is a collective remote resource where you can share and amend it without clashing.

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
    
    A good analogy would be that Git is a notepad, while GitHub is a noticeboard where others can pin their feedback and add notes to others'.

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

    Yes, so long as one can remind oneself of how it works.

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
    
    Yes.

Tech #3: Install and Explore Git and GitHub - Course
----------------------------------------------------

What is a GitHub work flow?

    It allows multiple developers to collaborate more effectively on frequently updated projects, by way of version control and branching.

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

    When I encounter complex issues, or when tasks don't work out as planned, I seek external advice. I also re-read any primers where necessary. 

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
    Not much, but I would probably seek second opinions about it. Namely how others handled it, and how the process could be made smoother.

Tech #4: Track and Commit - Primer
----------------------------------

Define "commit"

    A commit is best thought of as a game save point, in case something big has to be done, or a mistake has been made and needs to be fixed or rolled back.

Demonstrate best practices for commit messages

    Commit messages should be short and sweet, briefly describing what was done (but not why or how).

Describe the three states of a file in git (working, staged, commit)
    
    Working: The file is open and being edited.
    Staged: The file has been saved locally and is ready to upload.
    Commit: The file is uploaded and updated to Github.

Tech #5/6: Branch, Pull, Merge - Primer
-------------------------------------

What is Master?

    The Master is the central repository where the main "alpha" code is stored.

Why create a Branch?

    Branches come in handy when major changes, additions, or experiments are being made without adversely affecting the master. And when everyone is satisfied with the changes, they're merged back into the master.

Do the concepts feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
    
    The concepts are intuitive, at least in theory. Once the technical issues are navigated, it's easy when one knows how.

Tech #7: GitHub Fork and Clone - Challenge
------------------------------------------

What are some examples of when you would fork?

    Forking is ideal when big experimental changes have to be carried out in a more decentralised manner than with standard branches.

Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.

    1. Got to the original repo on Github and click Fork
    2. Go to the forked repo in my Github
    3. Click Settings and enable Issues
    4. Clone the forked repo to local
    5. In Explorer, open with VS Code
    6. Copy & paste from existing Reflections file to forked one
    7. Commit with the usual process

Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

    When a perfect copy of the local and Github forks appeared. 


Tech #8: Set Remotes and Sync Fork - Primer
-------------------------------------------

What is the difference between cloning from a forked or non-forked repo.

    Cloning from a forked repo gives a developer their own instance, while a conventional clone is still under the control of the original owner.

Can you think of an analogy to describe forking?

    Forking can be thought of as building 2 identical houses which can then be modified differently.

What is a remote?

    A remote gives a specified destination, such as a URL, for storing and updating data.


Tech #9: Set Remotes and Sync Fork - Challenge
----------------------------------------------

How are remotes set up?


How would you explain a remote to a non-technical person using an analogy?


How many times did you feel like "oh God I don't understand this"?



Tech #10: Setup new Repo & Create Blog - Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?


If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?


In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

    Taking breaks and not doing it all in one sitting usually works. The Udacity course on Github filled some vital gaps, by providing some handy tips on minor technical issues with Github.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

    It's variable so far, trying not to let the hard ones get in the way of the easy ones.

Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

    The practical components.

Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

    Material that's already been covered, or comes across as overly complex.

Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

    Sometimes I'm afraid of having to play catch-up, which I address by reminding myself that Rome wasn't built in a day.
